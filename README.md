# Eight_Puzzle_Game

An 8 puzzle is a simple game consisting of a 3 x 3 grid, where one cell is empty. 
The object is to move to cells around into different positions and having the numbers displayed in the ordered state. 

## Getting Started

Install Visual Studio (the game is implemented in C++) and OpenGL for visualisation of the solving process of each state (https://learnopengl.com/). 

## Example of initial and final state of the game
